# First use

This section concerns people that are not familiar with the software. For others, it is a prerequisite to expect the same results as mine. It is based on the [official ALERT software wiki](https://clasweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/ALERT_Software_and_Simulations/GEMC_coatjava_setup_on_farm).
